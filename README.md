# MOS Burgers Shop Management System

## Introduction

"MOS Burgers" is a locally-owned medium scale business that specializes in selling a wide variety of burgers, submarines, and soft drinks. To streamline and modernize operations, we aim to establish a digital system that can efficiently handle tasks such as Order Processing, Store Management, Bill Issuing, and Customer Management.

## Project Scope and Requirements 

### Store Management

The system should provide the following functionalities:

- **View all food items**: Display a comprehensive list of food items along with their price, quantity on hand, expiration dates for packaged foods, and the unique food item code.
- **Update and delete food items**: Modify the details of existing food items or remove them from the system.
- **Add new items**: Include new food items into the system.
- **Expiration notifications**: Alert the user about expired food items and remove those items from the system.
